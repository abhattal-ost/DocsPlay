# Maths

I have no idea how maths is entered, if at all. Oh there's a thing ...

$$
a = sqrt(b)
$$

Which seems to not really support much at all, as far as I can see. Maybe there's a way of [wangling-in a plugin](https://daggerok.github.io/fork-JozoVilcek-gradle-gitbook-example/chapter-1/math.html) \(that's a link, they're not so obvious, either\) that will let you do proper maths \(or maybe that plugin was for the open-source forerunner of gitbook, dunno\).
