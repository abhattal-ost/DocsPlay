# Maths

I have no idea how maths is entered, if at all. Oh there's a thing ...

$$
a = \int \sqrt{(b^2 + c)} \,db
$$

And another attempt,

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2^{-n} = 1
$$

This seems to support complex maths, I'm not sure what the syntax is, so far Latex-style seems to be working fine, so I guess it's ... Latex.

In the past there may have been ways of [wangling-in a plugin](https://daggerok.github.io/fork-JozoVilcek-gradle-gitbook-example/chapter-1/math.html) \(that's a link, they're not so obvious, either\) that will let you do maths, but maybe that plugin was for the open-source forerunner of gitbook ? Anyway, it seems you _can_ do maths in gitbook.
