# Cross-references

You can link to an [external URL](https://www.oxfordsemantic.tech/). You can link to pages, e.g. the [Maths page](../maths.md). You can link to headings within pages, e.g. [My second equation](../maths.md#my-second-equaltion-another-h2-heading) on the Maths page, or [this H3 heading](a-sub-page.md#a-h3-heading-on-a-sub-page) on a nested page.

A link [to a heading]() on a subsequently deleted page. The link now appears in strike-through text style.

~~The gitbook documentation doesn't mention much about sections, let alone cross-referencing them, which is worrying. Maybe you can do this using regular markdown, but any tooling seems scarce.~~

#### Something more.

Here is something more under a "Heading 3".
