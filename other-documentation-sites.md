# Other Documentation Sites

Just for reference and comparison, here are some other documentation sites.

* [Android Developers Guide](https://developer.android.com/guide), I think this looks quite nice.
* [Microsoft's TypeScript](https://www.staging-typescript.org/docs/handbook) pages.
* [Python doc pages](https://docs.python.org/3/), not so pretty but gets the job done.
* [neo4j docs](https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/current/), who are they ?
* [Stardog docs](https://www.stardog.com/docs/), nope, me neither ...
* [IBM DB2](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPGG_11.5.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.ref.doc/doc/r0006726.html), this one's just for Peter. Remember all this !
