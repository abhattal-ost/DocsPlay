# Introduction.

I'm not sure how flexible gitbook is in terms of look, layout \(both the site as a whole, and text\), support for mathematics etc. You do, however, get to integrate with the github repository of your choice, and there are a bunch of .md files for each page, which you can create and edit in the online app.

* **Questions.**
  * How customisable is it \(doesn't look like example sites are very different in style ?\).
* **Pricing.**
  * See [https://www.gitbook.com/pricing](https://www.gitbook.com/pricing) $300/month \(if you want features that include shareable links and better branding\).
* **Some example sites produced using gitbook.**
  * See [links here](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook/blob/master/docs/examples.md).
  * A page with an embedded youtube video : [http://handbook.enspiral.com/guides/contributing.html](http://handbook.enspiral.com/guides/contributing.html)
* **Documentation.**
  * See [https://docs.gitbook.com/](https://docs.gitbook.com/)
* **Where are the doc files ?**
  * [https://docs.gitbook.com/integrations/github](https://docs.gitbook.com/integrations/github)  _"The integration with GitHub is very easy to use: if you change your content on GitBook, your edits are pushed to a GitHub repository. Conversely, commits pushed to a GitHub repository are imported"_
* **Where are the docs being served from ?**
  * See [https://docs.gitbook.com/resources/faq\#where-and-how-is-my-data-stored](https://docs.gitbook.com/resources/faq#where-and-how-is-my-data-stored).  _"All user data and content is stored in the US on_ [_Google Cloud_](https://cloud.google.com/)_.
