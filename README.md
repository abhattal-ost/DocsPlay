# Introduction

I'm not sure how flexible gitbook is in terms of look, layout \(both the site as a whole, and text\), support for mathematics etc. You do, however, get to integrate with the github repository of your choice \([here's mine](https://github.com/abhattal-ost/DocsPlay)\), and there are a bunch of .md files for each page, which you can create and edit in the online app \(or you can edit the markdown directly and commit to github\).

I think [once-upon-a-time it may have been open-source](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook), before going commercial \(now there's an idea ...\).

* **Questions.**

  * ~~Can we do advanced maths, or plug-in some better maths module ?~~ Yes we can, looks like Latex format is supported ?
  * Can we create links to sections of text, and find broken links ?
  * How does search work, is there anything to configure, how good is it ?
  * How customisable is it \(doesn't look like example sites are very different in style ?\).

* **Remarks.**
  * The commits in github look pretty anonymous even if you enter a comment in the gitbook editor before saving. 
* **Pricing.**
  * See [https://www.gitbook.com/pricing](https://www.gitbook.com/pricing) $300/month \(if you want features that include shareable links and better branding\). 
* **Some example sites produced using gitbook.**
  * See [links here](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook/blob/master/docs/examples.md).
  * A page with an embedded youtube video : [http://handbook.enspiral.com/guides/contributing.html](http://handbook.enspiral.com/guides/contributing.html) 
* **Documentation.**
  * See [https://docs.gitbook.com/](https://docs.gitbook.com/)
  * Also [https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/markdown](https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/markdown)
  * Some 3rd-party doc about links in gitbook [https://seadude.gitbooks.io/learn-gitbook/content/](https://seadude.gitbooks.io/learn-gitbook/content/) 
* **Where are the doc files ?**

  * [https://docs.gitbook.com/integrations/github](https://docs.gitbook.com/integrations/github)  


    > The integration with GitHub is very easy to use: if you change your content on GitBook, your edits are pushed to a GitHub repository. Conversely, commits pushed to a GitHub repository are imported

* **Where are the docs being served from ?**
  * See [https://docs.gitbook.com/resources/faq\#where-and-how-is-my-data-stored](https://docs.gitbook.com/resources/faq#where-and-how-is-my-data-stored).

    __I presume this means actual doc-page content is there.
